# [Magic Navigation Menu Indicator: React.js Conversion](https://youtu.be/ArTVfdHOB-M)

## Overview
All credit goes to [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) for doing the heavy lifting.
I just converted their tutorial for this awesome navigation menu to work with React.js. Added function so the effect persists
on page refresh as well as the color of the ball changing during navigation.

## Installation
Fork & clone the repository. |
---------------------------- |
cd magic-navigation-react    |
npm install                  |
npm start                    |

## Build Notes
Again, full credit to [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog), I just provided this
for the community as a conversion for React.js. It was built using React.js, React Router 6, HTML, & CSS.
